1. Select all records after loading file

SELECT 
    log.log_id, log.ip_address, log.log_number 
FROM 
    t_log log
WHERE 
    log.log_number = (SELECT MAX(log_number) FROM t_log);

2. If we want to select with additional parameters

2.1 The first query for duration=hourly

SELECT
    log.ip_address, log.log_number
FROM 
    t_log log  
WHERE 
    log.request_time >= "2017-01-01 15:00:00" AND log.request_time < "2017-01-01 16:00:00" AND
    log.log_number = (SELECT MAX(log_number) FROM t_log) 
GROUP BY
    log.ip_address
HAVING 
    COUNT(log.ip_address) > 200;

2.2 The second query for duration=daily

SELECT
    log.ip_address, log.log_number
FROM 
    t_log log  
WHERE 
    log.request_time >= "2017-01-01 00:00:00" AND log.request_time < "2017-01-02 00:00:00" AND
    log.log_number = (SELECT MAX(log_number) FROM t_log) 
GROUP BY
    log.ip_address
HAVING 
    COUNT(log.ip_address) > 500;

3. Select the last report

SELECT 
    report.report_id, log.ip_address, report.start_date, report.duration, report.report_comment, log.log_number, report.report_number
FROM 
    t_report report
INNER JOIN 
    t_log_report_detail log_report_detail ON report.report_id = log_report_detail.report_id 
INNER JOIN 
    t_log log ON log_report_detail.log_id = log.log_id
WHERE 
    report.report_number = (SELECT MAX(report_number) FROM t_report);
